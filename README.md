#  M2STS Resources 

Dive into the world of **Scene Text Recognition** with our meticulously crafted dataset, designed to push the boundaries of diversity, realism, and robustness. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or just a curious mind, this dataset is your gateway to exploring the complexities of text in the wild.

We’ve built this dataset using **three distinct methodologies** to ensure it’s as diverse and challenging as real-world scenarios. Here’s how we did it:

### 1️⃣ **Real-World Images: Capturing the Chaos of Everyday Life**
-  **Captured with Mobile Cameras**: We snapped images using various mobile cameras to bring you the raw, unfiltered reality of text in the wild.
-  **Diverse Locations**: From bustling city streets to quiet railway platforms and office buildings, we’ve got it all. Day or night, we’ve captured it!
-  **Challenges Galore**:
  - **Curved, Multi-Oriented, and Multilingual Text**: Think English, Hindi, and Bengali text in all shapes and sizes.
  - **Distortions**: Blurring (thanks to motion or defocus), uneven lighting (shadows, artificial lights), and occlusions (text hiding behind objects).
  - **Perceptual Distortions**: Curved, angular, and irregularly shaped text that’ll make character segmentation a real brain teaser.

### 2️⃣ **Synthetic Augmentation for Simulating Environmental Effects:**
-  **Fog**: Simulating faded visibility for that eerie, hard-to-read text.
-  **Rain**: Causing localized distortions that’ll test your model’s resilience.
-  **Intense Sunlight**: Introducing glare and contrast reduction because, well, the sun doesn’t always play nice.

### 3️⃣ **Collected Public Images:**
-  **From Signboards, Memes, and Posters**: We handpicked publicly available images focusing on curved, low-contrast, and multi-aligned text.
-  **No Post-Processing**: What you see is what you get—no contrast or brightness adjustments here!
